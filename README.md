# HAR-Scraping-and-Enrichment
Since har.com doesn't provide an api, I've decided to write my own (ish). This tool will allow you to generate native filters on har.com, then parse out those filters and return json objects for each listing that matches your chosen filters. Additionally, it can also enrich that data by allowing you to filter listings based on whether or not AT&T Fiber is available. The tool was written for finding listings for sale, however it should also support listings for rent.
